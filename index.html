<!--The HoT LuNcH Story <br> style="border:5px; color: black;
The story of the LuNcH brand started more than 50 years ago when Dr. Sethuraman, a nuclear physicist, changed the life of a college student with a few simple words, “Let’s open a submarine sandwich shop.”
Sethu's Subway<br>
It was Sethu that gave college freshman Jamie the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop to help pay his tuition. Sethu provided an initial investment of Rs.85000, and a business relationship was forged that would change the landscape of the fast food industry and the lives of thousands.
The partners opened their first restaurant in Kurla, Bombay, where they served fresh, affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to grow over the decades but one thing remained the same and that was their core values and principles:<br> <br>

   a) Always provide exceptional service to your valued guests;
   b) Provide the highest quality menu items at a price everyone can afford and enjoy; and
   c) Keep operating costs low and ensure you have great systems in place and never stop improving.

These early principles continue to serve as the foundation for HoT LuNcH restaurants around the world-->
